        <p>This is a recipe for mozzarella sticks.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/3 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package mozzarella cheese sticks</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Whisk water and eggs together in a small bowl. Mix bread crumbs and garlic salt
                together in a medium bowl. Blend flour and cornstarch together in a third bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a large, heavy saucepan</li>
            <li>Dredge a mozzarella stick in flour; shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture.
                Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat.
                Place breaded mozzarella stick on a plate or wire rack. Repeat with remaining
                mozzarella sticks.</li>
            <li>Use a spider spoon or a pair of tongs to lower 3 to 4 mozzarella sticks into
                the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat and drain
                on paper towels. Repeat to fry remaning mozzarella sticks.</li>
        </ol>
